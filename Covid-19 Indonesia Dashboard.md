# COVID-19 INDONESIA DASHBOARD
### By Richard Reinhart

This is my personal project to make a dashboard about Covid-19 in Indonesia using Tableau.
This dashboard can provide information about Total Covid-19 Cases, Total Active Cases (people who are positive on the appointed date), Total Deaths, and Total Recovered in Indonesia from the beginning (March 2020) until the appointed date.
We can see total active cases in each province on the Indonesian map, new cases trend each day, positivity rate compared to total active cases yesterday, and some data from each province. 
I uploaded the dashboard in Tableau Public, so that people can see and use some fitur like Filter and Action Dashboard. I used Calculated Field, Parameter, and also some function such as IF, DATEDIFF, and ISNULL.
The appearance of the dashboard can be seen in the image below.
